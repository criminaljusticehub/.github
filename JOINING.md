# Joining the Criminal Justice Hub on GitHub

There are now separate organisations on GitHub for Conviction and the Criminal Justice Hub (CJH).

The organisations are:

- [Conviction](https://github.com/convictioncic) (also known as Conviction)
- [Criminal Justice Hub](https://github.com/criminaljusticehub) (also known as CJH)

This is to make it simpler to manage access between and across our two projects.

If you work in CJH and use GitHub, you should join CJH’s organisation on GitHub.

## Join the CJH organisation on GitHub

To join the Criminal Justice Hub’s organisation on GitHub, you must:

- be in CJH
- have an existing or new GitHub account

Before you can join, you must:

- [set up multi-factor authentication (MFA)](https://docs.github.com/en/authentication/securing-your-account-with-two-factor-authentication-2fa/configuring-two-factor-authentication)
- [add your criminaljusticehub.org.uk email address](https://docs.github.com/en/get-started/signing-up-for-github/verifying-your-email-address) as your GitHub account’s primary or additional email address
- [verify your email address](https://docs.github.com/en/get-started/signing-up-for-github/verifying-your-email-address)

Ask to become a member of CJH’s organisation on GitHub by either:

- posting a message on the #criminaljusticehub MS Teams channel
- emailing [design-team@criminaljusticehub.org.uk](mailto:design-team@criminaljusticehub.org.uk)

If you were already a member of the Conviction organisation, you’ll remain a member for now.

## Transferring a repository from Conviction to CJH

Find out how to [transfer a repository](https://docs.github.com/en/repositories/creating-and-managing-repositories/transferring-a-repository) on GitHub’s website.

There’s no deadline for transferring a repository from Conviction to CJH.

## Creating a new repository

If you’re a CJH staff member, you must create new repositories under the CJH organisation.

You must follow the guidance on:

- [storing source code](https://gds-way.cloudapps.digital) from The GDS Way
- [making source code open and reusable]([https://www.gov.uk/service-manual/technology/making-source-code-open-and-reusable](https://github.com/criminaljusticehub/inside-cjh/blob/main/CJH%20Service%20Standard.md)) from the Service Standard

Give your new repository a name that fully describes what it is, for example aws-route53-parked-cjhuk-domain.
