# Content Strategy

## Introduction

### What is a content strategy?
A content strategy is an agreed approach for the planning, creation, publication, management, and governance of content.

### Why do we need one?
Having a strategy helps us work together as a team. When we have a unified goal, everyone can begin to work towards it. It also helps the content designers make informed decisions when creating and reviewing content.

### What does it cover?
All long and short web copy, PDFs and other documents, infographics, videos, and printed materials.

Our strategy does not cover tone of voice, language choice, or accessibility guidelines. That information can be found below:

- Style guide
- Inclusive language guidelines
- Web content accessibility guidelines (WCAG) 2.2

## CJH Content Strategy

### Who are our audience?
Anyone impacted by the criminal justice system. Because our audience is varied, we must make sure that most people can access and understand our content.

### What is the purpose of our content?
To educate and inform. Our content is helpful and easy to understand.

### How do we create content?
Before we create any new piece of content, we need to be able to answer the following questions, which are adapted from the LocalGov Digital Content Guidelines:

- Is it original? If not, why aren’t we directly linking to it?
- Is it something our users want to know? We should never publish something just because we can.
- Can our users find it using terms that make sense to them? We use the same language as our users and ensure all keywords appear in our titles.
- How is our content structured? Our content is structured in two ways: Information based and Task focused.

For more information, refer to our SEO guidelines (link when ready).

### What does healthy content look like?
- Use clear and meaningful headings and sub-headings.
- Utilize bulleted lists to slow down the scanning eye.
- Keep one idea per paragraph, with sentences shorter than 25 words.
- Ensure content is easy to find, navigate, and read on all devices, with no attachments.
- The content should be understandable for an average reading age of 9 years.

### How do we maintain our content?
Every 12 months, review all content across the Criminal Justice Hub to ensure it’s still relevant and correct.

## Content Audit

### What is a content audit?
This is a review of all our current content.

### Why do we need one?
It will help us decide what content to update, keep as is, consolidate, delete, or create.

### How will it help us?
A good content audit will help us to understand the performance of our content, identify gaps in our content offering, and make informed decisions on how to improve our content and achieve our goals.

### How will we audit our content?
Begin to prioritise which pages to work on using analytics to understand what pages are the most visited, have the longest time spent on the page, are important for SEO, important from a business perspective, and have audience value.

Start tagging each page in a traffic light system of high, medium, and low priority content in the github content wall. This will help us to understand what pages we need to migrate first.

Remember, it’s always easier to add in content at a later date than to migrate everything just in case we might need it later. Now is the best time to really hone down our content and only keep what we need.
